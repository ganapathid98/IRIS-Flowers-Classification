# IRIS-Flowers-Classification
# Introduction on Classification
We all know about Iris Dataset, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.

# Working with Dataset
Before creating the model and training it, we have to preprocess the dataset. Preprocessing means converting the dataset into an understandable format before using it for any machine learning algorithms. It includes data transformation, data reduction, data cleaning, and many more.
# Conclusion on Classification
    * Mainly we focused on Logistic Regression
    * We took Iris Flowers dataset and performed a logistic regression algorithm
    * Finally, it classified flowers into their species.
    * And we got an accuracy of 97.37%, which shows that the model we built is very accurate.
